<h2><a name="Overview"></a>MON390 - Monitor for Dallas Contiguous Mode</h2>

<p>The MON390 is a Monitor program that allows you to debug applications on your
target hardware using the Keil µVision2 Debugger. You connect the µVision2
Debugger with a serial cable to a target board that uses a Dallas CPU&nbsp;(like
DS80C390, or DS80C400)&nbsp;running in Contiguous Mode. In this mode up to
16MByte memory are supported.<br>
</p>

<p>To get started, you must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Configure and install the MON390 on your target hardware as described
    under <a href="#Integration">Setup MON390 on your hardware</a>.
  <li>Select the correct Debug Driver as explained under <a href="#Configuration">Configure
    µVision2 for MON390</a>.
  <li>You need to adjust the project settings for your application as explained
    under ...
</ul>

<p>We recommend that you test your MON390 installation with an example project
available in the Keil\C51\MON390 folder before you start debugging with your own
test program.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Controlled program execution with single-stepping and multiple software
    breakpoints.
  <li>Viewing and changing CPU registers and memory.
  <li>Access to Special Function Registers (SFRs).
  <li>Execution of user programs in full speed <u>when no conditional
    breakpoints are set</u>.
  <li>MON390 is transparent for a user program's interrupt system.
</ul>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>One UART (can be shared with the user application in non-interrupt mode).
    MON390 uses a serial interface with a timer as baudrate generator.
  <li>2K bytes of code memory for MON390 program code.
  <li>32 bytes of xdata memory (von Neumann mapped)&nbsp;for MON390 data.
  <li>8 bytes stack space in the user program to be tested.
  <li>Code space for the user application must be configured as von-Neumann
    memory.
</ul>
<h2><a name="Philosophy"></a>How MON390 Works</h2>

<p>MON390 connects to the µVision2 Debugger via the serial interface. MON390 is
fully transparent for the user application. There are only a few issues to keep
in mind when you are using MON390:</p>

<ul>
  <li>MON390 requires that the programs you debug are located in RAM&nbsp;space.
    This is necessary because breakpoints are set by replacing instructions in
    your program with ACALL&nbsp;instructions. This operation, while completely
    transparent, may have side effects that affect the operation of your target
    program. Refer to Breakpoint Side Effects later in this section for more
    information.<br>
  <li>You may need to relocate your startup code, program code segments, and
    interrupt vector table.<br>
  <li>You may enable or disable the HALT command of the µVision2 Debugger. This
    is configured with the <b>Enable Serial Break</b> under <b>Options for
    Target - Debug: Use: MON390: Dallas Contiguous Mode - Settings</b>. If this
    is enabled the µVision2 Debugger and the MON390 use the serial interrupt
    vector to signal that the target program should stop running.<br>
</ul>
<h3>Breakpoint Side Effects</h3>

<p>Breakpoints are required to stop the user application for checking of the
system variables. To perform a breakpoint MON390 inserts a ACALL instruction in
the user program. This method avoids extra hardware for the breakpoint logic.
However, breakpoints can only be set in RAM memory. Another drawback is that a
ACALL instruction occupies up to three bytes. Therefore breakpoints may have
side effects when set before a label (jump target) on a one or two byte
CPU&nbsp;instruction. The following example demonstrates this problem.<br>
</p>

<p><b>User Program</b></p>

<pre>8000  E4        CLR     A
8001  74 03     MOV     A,#3
 :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:

			
 :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:

			
8010  80 ED     SJMP    8001
</pre>

<p>First, the user program is executed until address 8010 with a Debugger
command like&nbsp;<b>G, 8010</b>.</p>

<p>Then, a breakpoint is set at address 8000. The breakpoint is realized by
writing a ACALL instruction into the user program; this means that the user
program is modified by the breakpoint.<br>
</p>

<p><b>User Program Modified Due to Breakpoints</b></p>

<pre>8000  XX        ACALL           ; An ACALL instruction is
8001  XX XX     ???             ; written at address 8000. 
 :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:

			
 :&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:

			
8010  80 ED     SJMP    8001
</pre>

<p>When the user program continues execution at address 8010 the program jumps
to address 8001. However, this memory location is overwritten with the second
op-code byte of the ACALL instruction that is inserted due to the breakpoint at
address 8000. Therefore, the MOV&nbsp;A,#3 instruction will be not executed and
the behavior of the user program is unpredictable.</p>

<p>In real C&nbsp;applications such conditions are rare, however, you should
keep in mind that the ACALL instruction might influence the user program. In
such situations, you may single step in the user program. During single stepping
all instructions are executed without conflicts, since the debugger takes care
about conflicts.</p>

<h3>Program Execution</h3>

<p>When only exection breakpoints are defined, the user program is executed in
full speed.&nbsp; You may also use <b>access </b>or <b>conditional </b>breakpoints.
In this case, the application is executed in single steps and not in real time.
Single step execution is at least 1000 times slower.</p>

<h2><a name="Integration"></a>Setup MON390 on Your Hardware</h2>

<p>Preconfigured Mon390 version are available in the folder <b>Keil\C51\MON390\</b>.
If your target board is not available, you need to configure the <b>User Monitor</b>
for your target hardware.</p>

<p>The following steps are required to customize the <b>User Monitor</b>
project:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the <b>Keil\C51\MON390\User Monitor\MON390.uv2 </b>Project.
  <li>Open <b>Install.A51</b> with the editor.
  <li>Check the configurations settings in <b>Install.A51</b> and modify them,
    if necessary, to match your target hardware.
  <li>Customize the baudrate initialization code.&nbsp; You may use the
    µVision2 simulator to verify your settings.
  <li>Build target and load it into the target hardware device with the
    appropriate tool (depends on your hardware), or burn it to the boot ROM.
  <li>When you have Verify that the monitor starts up, by checking a blinking
    sequence on Port1, which the monitor generates after the initialization.
</ol>

<p>Program that may be used to verify the settings for a user Mon390 can be
found in the folder <b>Keil\C51\MON390\Examples</b>.</p>

<h2><a name="Configuration"></a>Configure µVision2 for MON390</h2>

<p>Once you have installed the MON390 firmware to the target hardware you may
configure the µVision2 Debugger for communication with the Dallas Contiguous
Mode target system.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start MON390 on the target system (typically with a
    CPU&nbsp;reset)&nbsp;before you start the uVision2 Debugger.
  <li>In µVision2, open the dialog <b>Project - Options for Target - Debug.</b>
  <li>Select<b> Use: MON390: Dallas Contiguous Mode</b>.
  <li>Enable <b>Load Application at Startup</b> to load the user program to the
    target hardware.
  <li>You may enable <b>Go till main</b> to execute the user program until the
    main() function is reached.
  <li>Configure the options below with <b>MON390: Dallas Contiguous Mode -
    Settings</b>:
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <h3>COM Port Settings</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Port</b>: PC COM port used to connect the target hardware.
    <li><b>Baudrate</b>: Communication baud rate with the target hardware.
  </ul>
  <h3>Cache Options</h3>

  <p>The MON390 driver implements data caches to speed-up screen updates.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Disable the cache options to view actual (un-cached) memory content of
      DATA (and SFR), IDATA, or XDATA space when you halt program execution.
      This way you can be certain you are viewing the current values of I/O
      ports, timers, or memory-mapped peripherals.
    <li>Enable the cache options to obtain maximum performance. This enhances
      especially the code disassembly and displaying of huge memory areas.
  </ul>
  <h3>Target Options</h3>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <li><b>Enable Serial Break </b>allows you to the HALT program exection. When
    this is enabled MON390 uses the serial interrupt vector and the serial line
    cannot be shared with the user program I/O&nbsp;routines. When this is
    disabled the user program may use putchar and getkey routines to perform
    character I/O&nbsp;via the serial interface in non-interrupt mode.
</ul>
<h2><a name="Tool Configuration"></a>Tool Configuration for MON390</h2>

<p>When using MON390, the complete target application is stored in von-Neumann
mapped RAM. This means that the <b>code</b> memory and <b>xdata</b> memory are
accessing the same physical memory space. This is required, since the target
hardware is not able to write into code space and the MON390 changes the program
code to set breakpoints in your application.</p>

<p>Therefore the EPROM and RAM areas that are entered in the dialog <b>Project -
Options for Target – Target – Off-chip Memory</b> must be non-overlapping
physical memory areas. These ranges are supplied to the Linker if you have
enabled the option <b>Use Memory Layout from Target Dialog </b>in the <b>LX51
Locate</b> dialog page. Therefore you should also check that this option is set.</p>

<p>Refer to the µVision2 projects in the folder <b>Keil\C51\MON390\Examples </b>and
review the tool configuration of this applications if you are not sure about the
tool configuration.</p>

<h3>Additional Settings when MON390 is Install at Address 0</h3>

<p>When the Monitor is installed at address 0 interrupt vectors will be
redirected as specified with the <b>INT_ADR_OFF</b> definition in the <b>INSTALL.A51
</b>file. Therefore you need to modify the START390.A51 startup code and you may
need to set an interrupt vector offset. The initial <b>LJMP</b> instruction
needs to be exchanged by an <b>AJMP</b> instruction. The Monitor-390 already
switches the CPU into contiguous mode, and therefore the <b>AJMP</b> instruction
can have a jump target anywhere in the 64KB CODE memory class that is used in
the <b>START390.A51</b>. The modification in the START390.A51 is as shown below:
<pre>?C_STARTUP      LABEL   NEAR
                ;DB      02H     ; LJMP in Classic 8051 Mode
                ;DW      WORD0 STARTUP1
	        AJMP    STARTUP1 ; AJMP in Contigous Mode</pre>

<p>The other modifications depend on the redirection address. If you just change
the interrupt vector address offset to a different 64KB segment (for example
C:0x010000) you need to enter the start address of the under <b>Project -
Options for Target - Target - Off-Chip Code memory</b>. For example: EPROM #1:
Start: 0x10000 Size: 0x40000. The uVision2 IDE converts this into a LX51
Linker/Locater CLASSES directive that will contain a CODE memory class that
starts at C:0x10000. If you redirect the start address to a page offset (for
example to C:0x008000 or C:0x018000), you need in addition also a change for the
?C_CPURESET?0 segment in START390.A51 as shown below:
<pre>?C_CPURESET?0   SEGMENT CODE OFFS 8000H
                RSEG    ?C_CPURESET?0</pre>
<h2><a name="Debugging"></a>Debugging with MON390</h2>

<p>Once the µVision2 Debugger is configured, you may start debugging with <b>Debug
- Start/Stop Debug Session</b>. The µVision2 Debugger connects to the Dallas
target system via the <b>MON390: Dallas Contiguous Mode </b>driver.</p>

<p>MON390 supports most µVision2 debugger features. For instance, you may
single-step through code, set breakpoints, and run your application. Variables
may be viewed and modified using the standard debugger features. Changing the
values of SFRs and memory of any type can be done in the Watch Windows or the
the Register tab.</p>

<p>More information about debugging with MON390 can be found in the User's Guide
<i>Getting Started with µVision2</i>, <b>Chapter 5. Testing Programs</b> and <b>Chapter
11. Debugging with Monitor-51</b>.</p>

<h3>µVision2 Restrictions When Using MON390</h3>

<p>There are several restrictions you must consider when using MON390 and the
µVision2 Debugger.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is not possible to use Debug - Memory Map to change the memory mapping
    of the 8051 system. This is because the memory mapping of the 8051 target
    system depends on hardware components.
  <li>The Performance Analyzer, Call Stack, Code Coverage, and Step Out command
    are not available with MON390.
  <li>The Periodic Window Update Option may not be used with MON390.
</ul>
<h2><a name="Troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>The following section gives you tips to solve common problems.</p>

<h3>If the Debugger does not connect...</h3>

<p>... it is typically a problem of MON390 code and xdata locations or the
initialization of the serial interface.<br>
</p>

<p>You should first verify that the target system's serial interface is
correctly configured. You may check this by using the µVision2 Simulation as
follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the µVision2 project that you have used to configure MON390, i.e. <b>Keil\C51\MON390\User
    Monitor\MON390.uv2</b>.
  <li>Select <b>Project - Options for Target - Debug: Use Simulator</b>.
  <li>Start program simulation with <b>Debug - Start/Stop Debug Session</b>.
    This loads the monitor program in simulation mode.
  <li>Start running the simulation (Debug - Go).
  <li>Verify the settings of the UART with the Serial Port Dialog (Peripherals -
    Serial). The baudrate is displayed correctly if you have entered the correct
    XTAL frequency in <b>Project - Options for Target - Target - Xtal</b>.
    Typically, the baudrate will not match the PC baud rate 100%, but it should
    be within 2.5% tolerance.
  <li>Check serial communications:
    <ul>
      <li>Open the serial communication window (View - Serial Window).
      <li>Right-click in the Serial Window and select Hex Mode from the context
        menu.
      <li>Enter <b>s0in=0xFF</b>&lt;ENTER&gt; in the Command Window to Input a
        0xFF character in the serial input stream.
    </ul>
    The µVision2 should show the Monitor identification 0xFE, 0xA5 in the
    serial window now.

    <p>If everything is correctly configured and you are still unable to connect
    to the hardware, you'll try to link the following test-program with your
    monitor install code and load it into your hardware. It shoud echo all
    inputs on the keyboard back in your Hyperterminal.</p>

    <pre>/*
 * Test Function: verify serial communication with HyperTerminal
 */
#include &lt;REG390.H&gt;

void main (void) {
  char c = 'A';
 
  //  init serial interface 19200 baud @ 20MHz
  PCON  |= 0x80;
  SCON0  = 0x50;   
  TMOD  |= 0x21;
  TH1    = 0xF8;
  CKCON |= 0x10;
  TCON   = 0x50;

  TI = 1;
  while (1) { 
    if (RI) { 
      c = SBUF; 
      RI = 0; }
    while (!TI);
      TI = 0;
      SBUF = c;
  }   
}</pre>
</ol>

<p>If the serial channel is correctly configured and you are still unable to
connect to the target hardware, the MON390 code or xdata space might not be
accessable.</p>

<h3>If MON390 stops working or behaves strange during debugging...</h3>

<p>... your application is most likely overwriting the user application program.
This might happen when the user application makes xdata write accesses to the
program code locations. Code and xdata memory must be non-overlapping areas,
since the MON390 requires von Neumann wired code space, which means that code
and xdata space are physically the same memory area. You should therefore check
the XDATA and CODE MEMORY MAPPING that is listed in the Linker MAP file and
verify that code and xdata space are not overlapping.</p>

<p>If MON390 does not single step CPU instructions or if you cannot read or
write SFR data locations the MON390 xdata memory area cannot be accessed from
code space. The MON390 data memory must be also von Neumann mapped xdata/code
space.</p>

<p>During operation, MON390 may report the following errors:</p>

<p><b>CONNECTION TO TARGET SYSTEM LOST</b>: µVision2 has lost the serial
connection to the MON390 program. This error might occur because your program
re-initializes the serial interface used by MON390. This error also occurs when
you single step in the serial I/O routines of your application.</p>

<p><b>NO CODE MEMORY AT ADDRESS xxxxx</b>: you try to download code into ROM
space or non-existing memory. The code memory must be von-Neumann mapped xdata/code
RAM.</p>

<p><b>CANNOT WRITE INTERRUPT VECTOR</b>:<b> </b>MON390 program cannot install
the interrupt vectors for the serial interface. This error occurs when the code
memory at address 0 cannot be accessed. Most likely this space is not
von-Neumann mapped.</p>
