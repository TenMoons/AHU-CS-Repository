    I do not have that paper, but have found what is probably a later
    variation of that figure in Stepp's dissertation, which lists the
    value "normal" for the first 2 classes and "irrelevant" for the latter
    2 classes.  I believe that "irrelevant" is used here as a synonym for
    "not-applicable", "dna", and "does-not-apply".  I believe that there
    is a mis-print in the figure he read in their PAMI-83 article.
 
    I have checked over each attribute value in this database.  It 
    corresponds exactly with the copies listed in both Stepp's and Fisher's
    dissertations.
