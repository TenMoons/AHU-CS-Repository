uVision2/ARM Developers Kit - RESTRICTIONS IN THE EVAL VERSION

1.  The µVision2 IDE/Debugger provided in the BETA release is unrestricted. However, it only works until September 2003. Thereafter, you must license a fully functioning version of the software. 

2.  We provide the GNU ARM tools (compiler, assembler, and so on). These are not limited or restricted in any way. 


PK51/C51 Compiler - RESTRICTIONS IN THE EVAL VERSION

1.  The 8051 compiler, assembler, linker, and debugger are limited to 2 Kbytes of object code but source code can be any size.  Programs generating more than 2 Kbytes of object code will not compile, assemble, or link.
 
2.  The debugger supports 2 Kbyte files or smaller. 

3.  The startup code generated includes LJMPs and code generated cannot be used in single-chip devices supporting less than 2K of program space (for example, Philips 750/751/752).
 
4.  Programs begin at offset 0x0800 and code generated with the evaluation software cannot be programmed into single-chip devices. 

5.  No hardware support is available for multiple DPTR registers.

6.  No support is available for user libraries or floating point arithmetic.

7.  The following Code Banking Linker, Library Manager and RTX-51 Tiny Real-Time Operating System, which are present in the PK51 Full Version, are not included in the PK51/C51 Eval Version.

PK166/C166 COMPILER - RESTRICTIONS IN THE EVAL VERSION

1.  The 166 compiler, assembler, linker, and debugger are limited to 4 Kbytes of object code but source code can be any size. Programs generating more than 4 Kbytes of object code will not compile, assemble, or link.

2.  The debugger supports 4 Kbyte files or smaller. 

3.  It is not possible to generate assembler source files or use in-line assembler features.


DK251/C251 COMPILER - RESTRICTIONS IN THE EVAL VERSION

1.  The 251 compiler, assembler, linker, and debugger are limited to 2 Kbytes of object code but source code can be any size. Programs generating more than 4 Kbytes of object code will not compile, assemble, or link.
