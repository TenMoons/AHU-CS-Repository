*** IMPORTANT NOTE ***
    Far Memory Support is only available in the PK51 package.
    If you have an CA51, DK51, or Evaluation Package the far memory
    support is not available and this example will not work.

This T89C51RD2 DEMO program shows you how to use the new features of 
C51 Version 7 and LX51 Linker/Locater to access the three available 
xdata areas: EEPROM, on-chip XRAM and off-chip xdata RAM.

All these memory areas (EEPROM, on-chip XRAM and off-chip xdata RAM)
are accessed in the same xdata address space and are overlapping the
same address ranges.  The 'far' memory support available in the PK51
Professional Developers Kit is configure to switch between these three
memory areas.  Therefore the user application has full access to all
three memory types at the same time.


This files can be used as template for own projects.

XBANKING.A51 configures the expanded 'far' memory space as EEPROM space
and on-chip XRAM space.

EEPROM.H  contains the data definitions that are stored in the EEPROM space.
EEPROM.C  defines the user class HDATA_EEPROM which starts at X:0x020000 

The memory type 'far' is used to store variables in on-chip xdata RAM.
The memory type 'xdata' is used to store variables in off-chip xdata RAM.

The LX51 CLASSES directive specifies the address ranges for the HDATA_EEPROM
and HDATA memory areas.  In uVision2 this memory classes are entered 
under Options for Target - LX51 Locate - User's Classes.

For save interrupt behaviour of the application it is required to invoke
the C51 Compiler with the directive VARBANKING (1).  Therefore the uVision2
project enables under Project - Options for Target: 'far' memory type support 
and Save address extension SFR in interrupts.  During an interrupt, the register
EECON that is defined as ?C?XPAGE1SFR will be saved and set to 0.

This EEPROM space is simulated under uVision2 with the V: memory type prefix.
This memory space can be manipulated using standard uVision2 debugging commands.
For example:
   D V:0                            // displays the EEPROM memory space
   SAVE EEPROM.HEX V:0, V:0x7FF     // saves the EEPROM memory space
   LOAD EEPROM.HEX                  // loads the EEPROM contents

It is also possible to display variables in the EEPROM space using standard
uVision2 features, i.e. the Watch Window.  The mapping for the uVision2 debugger
is configured via the ?B?xMEM symbols in the XBANKING.A51 config file.

*** Notes *** 
1. In the current version of the uVision2 simulator it is not possible to 
simulate the banking in the on-chip XRAM and off-chip xdata RAM space.

2. The C51 compiler allows to save ONE address extension SFR. This feature is 
enabled under Options for Target - Save Address Extensions SFR.  Since the
on-chip XRAM and the EEPROM use two different SFR registers, it is impossible 
to save both registers the EECON and the AUXR register during interrupts.
Therefore it is required to disable and enable interrupts when accessing on-chip
XRAM.

3. When the EEPROM support is not required, you may use the XBANKING4XRAM.A51 file
instead of the XBANKING.A51 file.  This file supports just the switching between
on-chip and off-chip xdata memory and is therefore useful on many 8051 variants.
