The AD8INPUT program reads all eight analog inputs of the
MSC1210 and outputs the values along with other A/D relevant
information via the serial interface.

This example shows a simple method to convert the A/D HEX
values into a voltage value that is more readable.  The 
algorithm uses only long arithmetic and avoids any loss of
precision as it would be the case when using single precision
floating point arithmetic.

Also shown is the usage of the uVision2 simulator. The file
Debugger.INI defines a signal function that creates a voltage
ramp on AIN0. Toolbox buttons are defined for easy access to 
this signal function.  The other analog inputs are set to 
random input voltages.

The example is available in three targets:

ISD51 - DAQ - 1.84MHz:
generates the program for the TI MSC1210-DAQ-EVM board that uses
1.8432MHz XTAL.  It can be debugged using the ISD51 In-System
Debugger with 9600bps communication baudrate.
(Note: The XTAL is given in the Options - C51 dialog)

ISD51 - EVM - 11.0592MHz:
generates the program for the TI MSC1210 EVM board that uses
11.0592MHz XTAL.  It can be debugged using the ISD51 In-System
Debugger with 9600bps communication baudrate.

Simulator:
generates the program for running without ISD51 (at 11.0592MHz)
or with testing with the uVision2 Simulator.

It should be noted that this example requires a common input
volatage and ground pin.  It runs therefore only on a modified
hardware. We recommend to use the AD4Input and AD_Interrupt 
examples instead which runs on unmodified hardware.
